This project features a Homepage interface that showcases two board types, allowing users to select their preferred board for an optimized and engaging experience. The game is designed to combine strategy, planning, and tactical decision-making, providing a highly interactive experience for users of all ages.

The project includes two variations of the Tiger & Goat game, each with unique gameplay rules and strategic depth:

1-> 2 Tigers vs 7 Goats

    Tigers are placed on the board at the start, while Goats are introduced one by one, with Goats taking the first turn.
    Once all Goats are placed, they move strategically to block the Tigers.
    Tigers aim to capture 2 Goats to win, while Goats strive to restrict Tigers’ mobility to secure victory.
    This version offers a fast-paced, highly engaging, and beginner-friendly gameplay experience.

2-> 2 Tigers vs 23 Goats

    Both 2 Tigers and 8 Goats are placed on the board at the start, with Tigers making the first move. The remaining Goats are introduced one by one.
    After placement, Goats move strategically to limit Tigers’ mobility.
    Tigers win by capturing 10 Goats, while Goats win by successfully blocking the Tigers.
    This version offers a more challenging and immersive strategic experience for advanced players.
