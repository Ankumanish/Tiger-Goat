The project features a Homepage interface that showcases two board types, allowing users to select their preferred board for an optimized and engaging experience.

It includes two variations of the Tiger & Goat game:

2 Tigers vs 7 Goats:

Tigers are placed on the board at the start, while Goats are introduced one by one, with Goats taking the first turn.

Once all Goats are placed, they move strategically to block the Tigers.

Tigers aim to capture 2 Goats to win, while Goats strive to restrict Tigers’ mobility to secure victory.

This setup provides a highly engaging and strategic gameplay experience.

2 Tigers vs 23 Goats:

Both 2 Tigers and 8 Goats are placed on the board at the start, with Tigers making the first move. The remaining Goats are introduced one by one.

After placement, Goats move strategically to limit Tigers’ mobility.

Tigers win by capturing 10 Goats, while Goats win by successfully blocking the Tigers.

This variant delivers a deeper, highly strategic, and immersive gameplay experience.

Additionally, the Settings window enables users to navigate back to the Homepage and provides access to configurable options, enhancing gameplay customization and overall user experience.
